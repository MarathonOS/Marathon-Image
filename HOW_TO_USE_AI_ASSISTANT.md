# Using AI Assistant to Build Marathon OS on Fedora

## For You (Patrick)

When you're ready to build Marathon OS on Fedora, simply give your AI coding assistant (Claude, etc.) this instruction:

---

## INSTRUCTION TO GIVE YOUR AI ASSISTANT:

```
I'm ready to build Marathon OS on my Fedora workstation.

Please read and follow the instructions in:
AI_AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md

This file contains complete step-by-step instructions for:
1. Verifying my Fedora environment
2. Building all Marathon OS packages
3. Creating flashable images
4. Flashing to my OnePlus 6 device
5. Post-boot validation

Please proceed through each phase, explaining what you're doing,
and asking for my confirmation before any destructive operations
(like unlocking bootloader or flashing).

My device is: OnePlus 6 (enchilada)
Target: Marathon OS with Marathon Shell
```

## What the AI Will Do

The AI assistant will:
1. ‚úÖ Check your Fedora environment has all required tools
2. ‚úÖ Initialize pmbootstrap with correct settings
3. ‚úÖ Verify Linux kernel version availability
4. ‚úÖ Check Marathon Shell version on GitHub
5. ‚úÖ Build all three packages (30-60 min)
6. ‚úÖ Create boot and system images
7. ‚úÖ Flash to your OnePlus 6
8. ‚úÖ Validate the running system
9. ‚úÖ Generate a build report

## What the AI Will Ask You

The AI will request your approval for:
- Installing packages (via `sudo dnf install`)
- Unlocking bootloader (WIPES DATA!)
- Flashing images to device
- Any configuration choices

## Timeline

**Total time:** ~2 hours for first build

- Environment setup: 15-30 min
- Package build: 30-60 min
- Flash & validation: 10-20 min

## Tips for Working with the AI

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Let it explain each step before executing
- ‚úÖ Review sudo commands before approving
- ‚úÖ Report errors immediately
- ‚úÖ Be patient during long builds (30-60 min is normal)

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Interrupt during package builds
- ‚ùå Approve destructive commands without understanding them
- ‚ùå Expect instant results (builds take time)

## If Something Goes Wrong

The AI has comprehensive error handling instructions including:
- How to check build logs
- How to clean and retry
- How to enter pmbootstrap chroot for debugging
- Device recovery procedures

## Expected Outcome

**Success looks like:**
```
‚úÖ Marathon OS boots on OnePlus 6
‚úÖ Marathon Shell UI appears
‚úÖ Touch input responsive
‚úÖ All validation checks pass
‚úÖ Touch latency < 16ms
‚úÖ Ready to use!
```

## Files Created for AI Assistant

1. **AI_AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (768 lines)
   - Complete step-by-step build guide
   - Error handling procedures
   - Success criteria
   - Agent behavior guidelines

2. **docs/FEDORA_SETUP.md**
   - Fedora workstation setup
   - Tool installation
   - Environment configuration

3. **docs/PRE_BUILD_CHECKLIST.md**
   - Pre-build verification
   - Device preparation
   - Known issues

## Quick Start

When you're on Fedora and ready:

```bash
cd Marathon-Image

# Option 1: Give AI the instruction above
# It will read AI_AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md and proceed

# Option 2: Manual build (if you prefer)
./scripts/build-and-flash.sh enchilada
```

## AI Agent Capabilities

The instruction document enables the AI to:
- ‚úÖ Detect and adapt to your environment
- ‚úÖ Handle missing tools gracefully
- ‚úÖ Verify each step succeeded
- ‚úÖ Make intelligent decisions (kernel version fallback, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Provide detailed progress updates
- ‚úÖ Generate comprehensive build reports

## Safety Features

Built-in safeguards:
- ‚úÖ Asks permission for destructive operations
- ‚úÖ Verifies bootloader unlock before proceeding
- ‚úÖ Checks device connection before flashing
- ‚úÖ Validates build output before flashing
- ‚úÖ Won't proceed if critical errors occur
